## Current Themes
### cf-white 0.2 (for !klaro \>=0.79)
1. Simple clean white theme (still work in progress)
2. SCSS variables for quick tweaks
3. Optional logo
4. Optional animation (animated.css)
5. Optional Font Awesome integration for buttons & toggles

## Usage
The SCSS file holds the configuration. This should be used to compile your own  CSS file. I am just providing the CSS file as a reference.

## Additional Info
**Idea Behind / Philosophy:**  

**cubicFUSION** is my personal playground. I planned to make many of my projects public, but time is limited and running customer projects always a priority.  

I am still doing a big cleanup of my toolset and will see what I can actually share or reuse. Some of these might be useful, inspiration or just an archive of broken ideas  ;)
